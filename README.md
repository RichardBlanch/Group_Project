Have you ever had a difficult time finding people in your classes who coud potentially help you studying? Have you ever felt like you lacked buddy? Do you want to ace your next test?
Our app, Study Finder has you covered. With Study Finder, which is exclusive to CU, you can the classes which you are in.
Once you add your classes, you can post to a larger "Class" feed, which everyone in the class can see.
You can also create smaller groups where only certain people within that group can see your messages.
Within a class or a group, you can also go to a map and set a distance. People in your class, or subject respectivley will show up within the distance that you set.

Download our app, and you'll not regret it. I hope you get an A on your next test.
